- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full time data analyst & programmer, making the transition from accounting & finance
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Harvards CS50 & intend to complete Python & IBM data analytics after!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything a beginner can improve his knowledge base on.
